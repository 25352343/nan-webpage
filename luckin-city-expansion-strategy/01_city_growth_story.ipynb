    "## Purpose of This Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step of the expansion analysis is to identify which cities in East China show **real growth potential**.  \n",
    "Instead of looking only at absolute GMV, we focus on **YoY growth** in the same quarter to reduce seasonality effects.  \n",
    "We also include **absolute GMV increase** and **store count change** to avoid small-base bias and to support actionable prioritization.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Business Question & Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Question\n",
    "Which cities achieved the fastest GMV growth in **22Q1 (Jan–Mar 2022)** compared with **21Q1 (Jan–Mar 2021)**?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Metrics\n",
    "- **GMV (Gross Merchandise Value)**\n",
    "- **YoY GMV Growth (22Q1 vs 21Q1)**\n",
    "- **ΔGMV (absolute GMV increase)**\n",
    "- **Active store count per city** (and YoY change)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Q1 vs Q1?\n",
    "Comparing the same quarter helps **reduce seasonality effects** (e.g., holidays and weather) and makes growth more comparable across years.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analytical Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "We aggregate city-level GMV and active stores for:\n",
    "- **21Q1 (Jan–Mar 2021)**\n",
    "- **22Q1 (Jan–Mar 2022)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Key logic:\n",
    "- Compute **YoY GMV growth** and **ΔGMV**\n",
    "- Track **store count changes** to support growth diagnosis\n",
    "- Apply a base GMV threshold in 21Q1 to avoid small-base outliers\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL used:\n",
    "- `sql/01_city_growth_q1_yoy.sql`\n",
    "\n",
    "All queries were executed in **Alibaba Cloud MaxCompute**, and results were reviewed online.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Findings (Summary)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Some cities show strong YoY growth and also meaningful **ΔGMV**, indicating scalable demand signals.  \n",
    "- High-GMV cities do not always have high YoY growth, so expansion priority should not rely on size alone.  \n",
    "- Store count changes vary by city, suggesting growth drivers are different (expansion-driven vs productivity-driven).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Strategic Implications\n",
    "\n",
    "Cities with strong YoY growth and meaningful scale (ΔGMV) are shortlisted for deeper analysis.  \n",
    "Next, we will check whether growth is sustainable at the store level (e.g., **GMV per store**, contribution of new stores vs existing stores).\n"
