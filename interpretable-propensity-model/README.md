## Interpretable Propensity Modeling for Targeted Marketing

This project builds an interpretable decision-tree-based propensity model to identify high-potential customers for term-deposit marketing.
The focus is on actionable segmentation rather than pure predictive accuracy, combining RFM-style behavioral features with demographic and financial constraints.

Key outputs include:
- Business-oriented evaluation using Top-10 Gains
- Rule-based segment summaries
- SHAP-based global feature interpretation
